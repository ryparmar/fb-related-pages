# Analysis of Facebook recommended (related) pages

This project is concerned with extracting data from Facebook pages and mining their divergent attitudes towards climate 
change. 
The project is part of my girlfriend's thesis, where I helped with scraping the data and then processing it.
As the code was not expected to be reused, not much care was given to its cleanliness and readability (tbh, it is ugly). ðŸ˜¥
The thesis is available [here](https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/148143?locale-attribute=en), unfortunately 
only in Czech.
The English abstract is available 
[here](https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/148143/120399369.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y).
In short, the thesis tries to indirectly analyze Facebook's page recommendation algorithm and its effect on the creation 
of information bubbles in relation to the climate crisis.

## Summary of steps

1. For each initially selected site (there were 20 in total), all recommended pages were scraped
2. Step 1. was repeated also for the scraped pages, i.e., two rounds of scraping was done
3. Pages that was not relevant to climate change were removed. We used a custom tf-idf-like score and hand-picked threshold
4. Rest of the climate change-related pages were manually annotated, i.e., their attitude towards climate change
5. A simple analysis of these annotated pages and their relationships was performed to see if FB's recommendation algorithm helps with breaking information bubbles


## Result

It's not that bad. FB is trying to recommend non-climate change denial pages a little more often.


## Future work

There is a plenty of space for improvement. 
Some simplifying assumptions were used in this project, for example, each of the recommended pages is considered to be equivalent.
However, to get to the last recommended page, the user has to click through. 
So, obviously, those are not equivalent and should be reweighted.
